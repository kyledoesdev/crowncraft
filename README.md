# Setup Instructions üìú
----------------------------------------------

- Download the Modpack [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JYMbL8FdLUScA9RQyMdYKWWAnoc_Bz_d/view?usp=sharing) (Google Drive Link)
- Download [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app#download-options)
  - If you are on Windows, Overwolf or standalone should work fine.
  - If you are linux, you may need to download curseforge through your distributions package manager or follow the linux setup instructions on CurseForge's website.
  - If you are on Mac, download the Mac option (Your machine may struggle to run the server at a high FPS, but it should still be playable.)
- Download modpack.zip from this repo. This is a folder containing all of the mods the server will be using. You can download this by clicking on the file, and then clicking the download raw file button on the right hand side.
- Launch CurseForge, Select Minecraft and Select ‚ÄúCreate New Profile‚Äù in the upper right-hand corner.
- Select the ‚ÄúImport‚Äù option From there you will select the ‚Äúmodpack.zip‚Äù Folder that you downloaded before.
- To run smoothly we recommend you allocate at least 6GB of memory. In order to change it you will select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù in CurseForge which is located in the bottom left-hand corner.
- Then select ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù on the left-hand side. Once scrolling down you will see a slider option that will allow you to choose  how  much memory to allocate. 
- Once the mods finish installing and you‚Äôve adjusted your memory you can click ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù when hovering over the profile this will open  the Minecraft Launcher and you will just hit ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù once again.
### <b> Note The first time launching will take a while. Please be patient and don't close anything down. </b>

# Server Rules: üëÆ
----------------------------------------------

- This server has proximity voice chat enabled. Any form of racial, homophobic, ableist, transphobic or xenophobic remarks made in any manor towards another player via voice or text chat will result in an immediate ban. Keep nasty thoughts to yourself ez pz.
- No Stealing anything from any other player.
- No Griefing without prior permission. Don‚Äôt go around killing people especially if you don‚Äôt know them. if you do end up killing someone accidentally or with permission, help retrieve their inventory.
- Don‚Äôt Destroy other players builds or items without prior permission. If you, or a nearby creeper, destroys something that isn‚Äôt yours then you have to fix it to the best of your ability. If you are unable to fix it then you are to either leave a sign or book in game or post in the discord what happened. You can also ask another player for help if any are online at the time, most would be more then willing to help.
- Pay for items in the Shopping District at the price listed by the owner. If there is some confusion on what to pay and how much to take you can ask another online player or post in discord.
- Just don't be a dick bro.

### Punishment for breaking the rules will most likely end with being banned from the server. The specifics will be decided on a case-by-case basis.
