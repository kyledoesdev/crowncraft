# Friendship Time Modded Minecraft Server Rules & Instructions 
(JAVA ONLY)

Hello all and welcome to Friendship Time Modded Minecraft Server! 

This is going to be an OPEN server so feel free to invite friends but note we may ask they first redeem the channel point reward on either gabrieldontsnap’s or spacelampsix’s Twitch channel and join one of their discords if we do not personally know them. This is just a precaution for potential griefers :)

The server is also whitelisted so all Minecraft IGN’s will need to be shared with us to allow you on.

### Server IP: 167.114.44.139:25565
----------------------------------------------
# Setup Instructions
----------------------------------------------
- Download CurseForge (either option for Windows will work) https://www.curseforge.com/download/app#download-options
- Download Friendship_Time_final.zip from this repo. This is a folder containing all of the mods the server will be using. You can download this by clicking on the file, and then clicking the download raw file button on the right hand side.
- Launch CurseForge and select “Create New Profile” in the upper right-hand corner.
- Select the “Import” option From there you will select the “Friendship_Time.zip” Folder that you downloaded before.
- To run smoothly we recommend you allocate at least 6GB of memory. In order to change it you will select “Settings” in                                                                                  CurseForge which is located in the bottom left-hand corner.
- Then select “Minecraft” on the left-hand side. Once scrolling down you will see a slider option that will allow you to                                                                                  choose  how  much memory to allocate. 
- Once the mods finish installing and you’ve adjusted your memory you can click “Play” when hovering over the profile                                                                                      this will open  the Minecraft Launcher and you will just hit “Play” once again.
